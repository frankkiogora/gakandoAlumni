      <h2>Gakando Primary School and the Power of Alumni Associations</h2>
      <p>Gakando Primary School is a public primary school located in Meru County, Kenya. The school was established in 1956, and since then has been providing quality education to children in the area. The school is known for its commitment to quality education and the strong community it has built around it.</p>
      <p>Recently, a group of former students of Gakando Primary School came together with a wonderful idea to start an alumni association. This idea was driven by the desire to give back to the school that had played a pivotal role in their lives, and to help current and future students of the school achieve their full potential.</p>
      <p>The alumni association was officially launched in August 2022, and has since become a powerful force in supporting the school and its students. Through various fundraising activities and donations, the alumni association has been able to support the school in a number of ways, including funding for new textbooks, classroom materials, and scholarships for needy students.</p>
      <h3>The Power of Alumni Associations</h3>
      <p>The success of the Gakando Primary School alumni association is a testament to the power of alumni associations in supporting schools and communities. Alumni associations provide a way for former students to remain connected to their alma mater and to give back in meaningful ways. They can also serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for current and future students of the school, showing them what is possible with hard work and dedication.</p>
      <p>Alumni associations can also play a critical role in supporting schools and communities in need. Through fundraising and other activities, alumni associations can provide much-needed resources and support to schools that may not have access to adequate funding or other resources. This support can make a significant difference in the lives of students and the community as a whole.</p>
